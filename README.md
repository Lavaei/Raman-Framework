# Raman Framework (DEPRECATED)
Raman framework idea is removing css & javascript coding. Many helpers and forms has been designed that generate css & javascripts codes just with php functions. some actions like uploading files, validating forms(with js and php) , etc needs NO CODE!
What is the advantage? 
1. Easy designing: Reduce codes and fast programming 
2. Easy editing: You can change helpers in all pages easily. just change helper (or extend from that)
3. Fully Object Oriented: while CSS is not even a programming language! It means you can make change or create new helpers by extending from existing helpers
